Contracts can deploy another contracts
Contracts can interact with each other => Composable

import "./file.sol" => no need to name it as a variable

Contracts like classes in js => can import and create: new Contract() //this deploys a new contract

Files can have different solidity versions if one isn't lower than the other (if they are compatible)

To interact with a contract you need the Address and the ABI => Application Binary Interface

We can access this information inside Remix under the compilation tab => compilation details

We can have a contract inherit the functions from another contract:
Need to import the contract and then "Contract <ContractName> is <Imported Contract>"

We can override functions with inheritance:
	virtual or override
	we need to specifier override declaration
In order for a function to be overridable we need to add the key word virtual on the origian function declaration
