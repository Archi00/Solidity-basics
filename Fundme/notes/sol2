The smart contract connectivity problem
	Smart contracts are deterministic by nature as the nodes need to reach consensus
	Adding random data, etc nodes wouldn't be able to agree or reach consensus

Oracles => Any devide that interacts with the off-chain world to provide external data or computation to smart contracts

ChainLink => Decentralized Oracle Network (Modular)
	Cdkfjdan be costumized

ChainLink Data Feeds 
	Gets data from different exchanges and data providers
	Passes the data through a series of chainlink nodes that figures out what is the actual price (data) 
	Delivers the data through a single contract (reference contract, price feed contract, data contract) on chain
	// data.chain.link
