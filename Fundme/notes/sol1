All the transactions that we send have:
	Nonce => tx count for the account
	Gas Price => price per unit of gas (wei)
	Gas Limit => max gas that this tx can use [value]
	To => addres that the tx is sent to  [value, function]
	Value => amount of wei to send 
	Data => what to send to the To address (function call, deploy contract...) [value, function]
	v,r,s => components of tx signature

Value call can populate Gas Limit, To address and data
Function call can populate To address, data

Contract addresses can hold native tokens they have an address == wallet

To access the value being sent we can use the property "value" inside the "msg" object. 
	msg.value

1e18 wei == 1 * 10 ** 18 == 1000000000000000000 == 1eth

require built in function makes the condition passed as a must, if condition not met tx reverted with error message

Tx reverted => undo any actions before and send remaining gas back
