We can use interfaces to interact with oracles
(AggregatorV3Interface)

We can import interfaces directly from github => chainlink has npm packages @chainlink/contracts

msg.sender => address from the caller 

Library lets you add functions to types

We can import library as a contract with it's functions being internal and inside local contract:
	"using <library name> for <type>"
	*usiing PriceConverter for uint256*

We can define a library the same way as a contract: "library <library name> {}"
When you use the function on an object "this" will be the 1st parameter:
	"msg.value.getConversionRate() == getConversionRate(msg.value)"
